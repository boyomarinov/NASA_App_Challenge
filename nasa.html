            <h2>NASA International Space Apps Challenge</h2>
            <p>The International Space Apps Challenge is an international mass collaboration focused on space exploration that takes place over 48-hours in cities around the world. The event embraces collaborative problem solving with a goal of producing relevant open-source solutions to address global needs applicable to both life on Earth and life in space. NASA is leading this global collaboration along with a number of additional government collaborators and 100+ local partner organizations.</p>

            <h2>The challenge: Bootstrapping of Space Industry</h2>
            <img src="moonville.jpg" class="big-img" />
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The concept of establishing a presence on the Moon in some form is elusive to many people. How hard is it? Could we do it? Why should we? What resources does the Moon have that could support an industry? We want to raise awareness about both the potential for a lunar industry and the challenges of developing one.</p>

            <h3>Challenge description</h3>
            <p>Develop a simulation of a lunar industry through a series of "bootstrapping" stages until it becomes self-sustaining. The strategy is to decide which machines to build first and how many of them, using resources launched from Earth and available from the Moon. A major part of this challenge is learning what the purpose and value of a lunar industry could be and incorporating it into the game.</p>
